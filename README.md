# project straylight

The intent of the straylight project is to introduce a series of accelerators that can help security researchers and companies improve their information security capabilities. 

"Stray light is light in an optical system, which was not intended in the design. The light may be from the intended source, but follow paths other than intended, or it may be from a source other than the intended source."

Success in security, hacking, and puzzles all require creativity, ambition, curiosity, and logic. Building a resilient defense is hard. Building an effective security program is exponentially harder.

Let's solve this together!

### Accelerator 0: Introduction - Project Straylight - Security Accelerators, Mentoring, and Collaboration
* The introductory blog post can be accessed at https://medium.com/@brevityinmotion/introduction-project-straylight-security-accelerators-mentoring-and-collaboration-7426a32bd940?sk=7913ec6788585ac17c22065a64b1f267.

### Accelerator 1: External IP domain reconnaissance and attack surface visualization in under 2 minutes.

It provides a walkthrough of the process. The corresponding source code and Jupyter notebooks are contained within this repository to replicate the capability.

### Accelerator 2: Elevating your career through scientific computing and the cloud
* This is the presentation given during the @VillageRedTeam and @texas_cyber June'gle 2020 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d2c8-e6klE). The presentation slides are in this repo at https://github.com/brevityinmotion/straylight/blob/master/2020-Junegle-RyanElkins.pdf. Thank you for the opportunity @santosomar and @cedoxX!
